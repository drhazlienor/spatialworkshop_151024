# spatialworkshop_151024
Geospatial Disease Modeling and Visualization using R workshop on 15 October 2024 organized by the Digital Health Science Unit, School of Medical Sciences and the Research Creativity and Management Office (RCMO) of Universiti Sains Malaysia.
Workshop Overview:

Disease risk models are critical for guiding public health and policy decisions. This workshop will introduce participants to statistical methods, modeling approaches, and visualization techniques to analyze geospatial health data using R. The training will also cover how to create interactive maps of disease risk, dashboards, and Shiny web applications that allow communication of insights to collaborators and policymakers.

We will explore reproducible data science examples using real-world health data, such as cancer and malaria. The following topics will be covered:

- Introduction to Spatial Data: Areal, geostatistical, and point patterns; R packages for retrieval, manipulation, and visualization
- Statistical Methods for Spatial Data: Describing, analyzing, and simulating spatial data
- Bayesian Spatial Models: Fitting models using INLA and SPDE approaches
- Communicating Results: Interactive visualizations, dashboards, and Shiny web applications
